# Prototypical Networks for Few-shot Learning
Tensorflow implementation of NIPS 2017 Paper [Prototypical Networks for Few-shot Learning](http://papers.nips.cc/paper/6996-prototypical-networks-for-few-shot-learning.pdf).    

This code is adopted from
* Official implementation of Prototypical Networks in PyTorch ([jakesnell/prototypical-networks](https://github.com/jakesnell/prototypical-networks))
* Tensorflow version of the official implementation ([abdulfatir/prototypical-networks-tensorflow](https://github.com/abdulfatir/prototypical-networks-tensorflow))
* Tutorial by ([PacktPublishing](https://github.com/PacktPublishing/Hands-On-Meta-Learning-with-Python)).

## How to Run
* Download the Omniglot dataset by executing `download_omniglot.sh`
* Run `prototypical_networks.py`
